A modal verb (also modal, modal auxiliary verb, or modal auxiliary) is a type of verb that is used to indicate modality – that is: likelihood, ability, permission, and obligation. Examples include the English verbs _can/could_, _may/might_, _must_, _will/would_, and _shall/should_. In English and other Germanic languages, modal verbs are often distinguished as a class based on certain grammatical properties.
