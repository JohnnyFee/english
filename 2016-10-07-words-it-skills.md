### **How to Use Skill Lists to Help Your Job Application**

This A to Z list can assist you in your application process in a few different ways:

**Identify which skills you have:** Sometimes, candidates take their skills and abilities for granted. When you have been doing a task or have had a certain bit of knowledge for awhile, it can seem unexciting. For an employer, though, your personal mix of skills — including the ones you take for granted — could make you the perfect candidate.

That is, if an employer is looking to upgrade documentation, then of two candidates with the necessary coding experience, the candidate who also mentions technical writing abilities will stand out and have an edge. Go through this list and identify all the skills you have.

**Identify which skills employers need:** As you review the list above, what might stand out most is skills you need to get a job, and do not currently have. If there is a skill on this list that you often see mentioned in job postings, consider taking a class or finding a way to gain experience in the area.

**Emphasize skills in your application:** Your cover letter and resume are a place to showcase your skills. (Here's information on [what to include in a resume skills section](https://www.thebalance.com/what-to-include-in-a-resume-skills-section-2063321).) As well, you'll also want to highlight your skills during interviews. Keep these skills in mind when you are reviewing job advertisements — think about how the position's requirements match up to these skills.
