## 谈论问题

在确定一个问题后，你可能想详细加以解释。以下是一些帮助你进行解释的表达。


- I have insomnia. **The problem is** that I can't stop thinking about work.	 	我患有失眠症。问题在于我老想着工作。
- She can't quit smoking. **One big problem** is that her husband smokes, too.	 	她戒不了烟。一个大问题是她的丈夫也抽烟。

that 可省略而不会造成意义的改变。

- He is very overweight. **The trouble is** he eats too much chocolate.	 	他非常胖。问题是他吃太多巧克力了。
- She can't quit smoking. **One big problem** is her husband smokes, too.	 	她戒不了烟。一个大问题是她的丈夫也抽烟。

- You should **give up** smoking
- You had better **break the habit**.
- I should **quit** eating so much chocolate.
- You had better not **begin** gambling.
