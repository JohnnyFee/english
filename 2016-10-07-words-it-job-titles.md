### **Information on the Field of Information Technology**

According to the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](http://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/home.htm) (BLS), jobs in information technology are growing at above average rates, with 12% growth expected from 2014 to 2024. This growth is no big surprise, as technology continues to flourish with new websites, applications, and products launching constantly.

The "Internet of Things," or web-connected products, are a major development in the same way mobile apps were a few years ago. Now, it is common for baby monitors to be viewable through a personal online stream, and to be able to set home alarms, start the coffee brewing, or turn heat on and off remotely, by using web-based apps.

The BLS has the median annual salary for IT jobs as $81,430, as of May 2015.
